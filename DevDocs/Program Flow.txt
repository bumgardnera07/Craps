Things I could improve but won't:
Game nos are unique to each player and reset when history is deleted

Could do so with this Query, but Rank is not supported

/*
 SELECT       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Game.ID ASC) AS GameNo, COALESCE ('' + Game.Result, 'N/A') AS Result, COALESCE (' ' + Roll.Point, 'Not Set') AS Point, Roll.RollNum, Roll.Die1, Roll.Die2,  Roll.Die1 + Roll.Die2 AS Total,
                         Game.[Player ID], Roll.Id
FROM            Roll LEFT OUTER JOIN
                         Game ON Game.Id = Roll.Game
ORDER BY Roll.Id DESC
*/
