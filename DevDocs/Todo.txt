UI Tests/ ASync Tests

Stupid Visual GroupBox bug

Pass datatable from main form to child forms so only one instance of data tables is modified throughout the whole program

Game nos are unique to each player and reset when history is deleted

Could do so with this Query, but Rank is not supported

/*
 SELECT       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Game.ID ASC) AS GameNo, COALESCE ('' + Game.Result, 'N/A') AS Result, COALESCE (' ' + Roll.Point, 'Not Set') AS Point, Roll.RollNum, Roll.Die1, Roll.Die2,  Roll.Die1 + Roll.Die2 AS Total,
                         Game.[Player ID], Roll.Id
FROM            Roll LEFT OUTER JOIN
                         Game ON Game.Id = Roll.Game
ORDER BY Roll.Id DESC
